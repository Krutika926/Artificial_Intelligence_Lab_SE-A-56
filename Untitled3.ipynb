        "*   **Traversal Order**: BFS explores nodes layer by layer (e.g., `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']`), visiting all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking (e.g., `['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'C']`), going deep into one path first.\n",
        "*   **Data Structure**: BFS uses a queue (First-In, First-Out) to manage nodes, ensuring breadth-first exploration. DFS uses a stack (Last-In, First-Out), either explicitly or implicitly via recursion, to drive its depth-first exploration.\n",
        "*   **Space Complexity**: For BFS, space complexity can be significant for wide graphs (storing all nodes at the widest level). For DFS, space complexity can be significant for deep graphs (storing all nodes along the longest path).\n",
        "*   **Applications**: BFS is typically used for shortest path in unweighted graphs or network broadcasting. DFS is used for cycle detection, topological sorting, finding connected components, or solving maze-like puzzles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A graph with 7 nodes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and its connections was successfully defined using an adjacency list.\n",
        "*   The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, implemented using a queue, produced the traversal order `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']` when starting from node 'A'. This demonstrates its layer-by-layer exploration.\n",
        "*   The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, implemented using a stack, produced the traversal order `['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'C']` when starting from node 'A'. This illustrates its deep exploration of one path before backtracking.\n",
        "*   The distinct traversal orders (`['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']` for BFS vs. `['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'C']` for DFS) clearly highlight their fundamental difference in exploration strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The choice between BFS and DFS depends on the specific problem being solved; for instance, BFS guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs, while DFS is efficient for pathfinding where depth is prioritized or for checking connectivity.\n",

        "**1. Use of Heuristic Function and `f_score` Calculation:**\n",
        "*   The `heuristic_func` (Manhattan distance in this case) estimates the cost from the `current_node` to the `end` node (`h_score`). This estimate guides the search towards the goal.\n",
        "*   The `f_score` for each node is calculated as `g_score + h_score`, where `g_score` is the actual cost from the `start` node to the `current_node`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Balancing Exploration and Cost:**\n",
        "*   A* balances exploration and cost through its `f_score`. The `open_set`, implemented as a min-priority queue, always retrieves the node with the lowest `f_score`.\n",
        "*   A low `g_score` (actual cost from start) means the path taken so far is short. A low `h_score` (estimated cost to end) means the node is perceived to be close to the goal.\n",
        "*   By prioritizing nodes with the lowest `f_score`, A* ensures that it explores paths that are both *short so far* and *likely to lead quickly to the goal*. This prevents it from getting stuck exploring long, inefficient paths (like pure DFS) or blindly expanding all nodes at a given depth without considering the goal (like pure BFS).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Properties of the Path Found:**\n",
        "*   The A* algorithm found the path `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]` for the given grid, start, and end points. This path successfully navigates around the obstacles.\n",
        "*   A* is generally considered **optimal** (guaranteed to find the shortest path) and **complete** (guaranteed to find a path if one exists) when used with an **admissible heuristic**. An admissible heuristic never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal. The Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic for grid-based movement where only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed and the cost of each move is uniform (1, as implemented).\n",
        "*   The visualized `path_grid` (`[[0 2 2 2 2] [0 1 0 1 2] [0 1 0 0 2] [0 0 0 1 2] [0 0 0 0 0]]`) clearly shows the calculated path, marked by '2's, successfully avoiding obstacles (marked by '1's)."

        "The A* algorithm demonstration successfully illustrated its functionality and effectiveness in finding optimal paths. Its functionality is driven by the use of an `f_score` (calculated as `g_score` + `h_score`) to prioritize nodes, efficiently balancing the cost from the start node (`g_score`) with an estimated cost to the goal (`h_score`). Its effectiveness in finding optimal paths is confirmed by its ability to reliably identify the shortest path in a grid environment while navigating obstacles, a property guaranteed when an admissible heuristic (like Manhattan distance for grid-based movement) is employed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A 5x5 grid environment was successfully defined, featuring `0` for walkable cells and `1` for obstacles. The starting point was set at `(0, 0)` and the end point at `(4, 4)`.\n",
        "*   The Manhattan distance heuristic function was implemented to estimate the cost from any given node to the end node, which is an admissible heuristic for grid-based movement.\n",
        "*   The A\\* search algorithm was implemented using a priority queue (managed by `heapq`) to store nodes based on their `f_score`, ensuring efficient exploration.\n",
        "*   The algorithm successfully identified the shortest path from `(0, 0)` to `(4, 4)` as `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]`.\n",
        "*   This path was visually represented on a grid copy, where path nodes (excluding start/end) were marked with `2`, clearly demonstrating navigation around obstacles.\n",
        "*   The A\\* algorithm effectively balances exploration (through `g_score`) and goal-direction (through `h_score`) by prioritizing nodes with the lowest combined `f_score`, leading to an optimal and complete pathfinding solution for the given conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The demonstration highlighted that the choice of an admissible heuristic function is crucial for A\\* to guarantee an optimal path while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
        "*   Further exploration could involve testing A\\* with different grid complexities, varying obstacle distributions, or incorporating diagonal movements to observe changes in pathfinding behavior and optimality.\n"

        "*   A 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game board was successfully initialized with empty cells represented by a space character (' ').\n",
        "*   The `check_win` function accurately identifies win conditions for a given player across rows, columns, and both main and anti-diagonals.\n",
        "*   The `check_draw` function correctly determines a draw state when no available moves remain and neither player has achieved a win.\n",
        "*   The `get_available_moves` function returns a list of `(row, column)` tuples for all empty cells on the board.\n",
        "*   The `minimax` function was implemented with base cases for win/loss/draw scenarios, returning scores of `10 - depth` for the maximizing player's win, `depth - 10` for the minimizing player's win, and `0` for a draw.\n",
        "*   The recursive logic within `minimax` correctly evaluates game states by exploring all possible moves, temporarily making them, calling itself recursively, and then undoing the moves to explore alternative branches.\n",
        "*   When applied to an initial empty Tic-Tac-Toe board, the Minimax algorithm identified `(0, 0)` as the optimal first move for player 'X', with an associated score of `0`.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The implemented game logic and Minimax algorithm provide a solid foundation for building an AI player for Tic-Tac-Toe. Further development could involve integrating this with a game loop to allow two AI players or a human player against the AI.\n",
        "*   To enhance performance for more complex games, consider implementing alpha-beta pruning within the Minimax algorithm to significantly reduce the number of game states that need to be evaluated.\n"
